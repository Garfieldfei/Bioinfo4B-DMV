# Bioinfo4B-DMV

Data Manipulation and Visualization project for the course "Bioinformatics for Beginners"

## Project

somatic copy number segmentation data downloaded from TCGA COAD and READ (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/).
There are three major molecular pathways involved in colorectal cancer(CRC), including the chromosomal instability (found in 85% cases), microsatellite instability and CpG island methylator phenotype pathways. Copy number alterations (CNAs) are somatic changes that cause the gain or loss of DNA sections (>1â€‰kb) from a normal genome. In this project, we are going to explore the pattern of copy number alternations across CRC patients and the relationship with MSI status.
